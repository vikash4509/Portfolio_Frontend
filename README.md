**##Challenges Faced & Solutions**
*Challenge:* Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Errors

*Solution:* Configured the backend Node.js server with a flexible CORS policy to accept requests from both the main Vercel production domain and dynamic preview URLs generated during development.

*Challenge:* Deployment Bugs on Render

*Solution:* Debugged several Module Not Found errors caused by case-sensitivity differences between the local Windows environment and the Linux-based deployment server. Corrected all file import paths to ensure they matched the exact casing of the filenames.

*Challenge:* Corrupted Local Git Repository

*Solution:* Resolved a fatal: in unpopulated submodule error by identifying and removing a nested, accidental Git repository within the project structure, which allowed for a clean commit and push history.
